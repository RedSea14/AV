1.Visit me on Saturday
27 October 2021
 Dear Paul,
I hope you are well. I’m going to visit you this Saturday. Newyork is so far from my country, so I’ll get there by plane. I’ll arrive there about 7 a.m. I think we will go camping to try new things. We can also go to a nearby lake for fishing or swimming. After all, this trip will offer us the opportunity to take a long walk in the wilderness and observe nature in its true habitat.
Your friends,
Thanh

2. party last night
Hi Chris,
I know I didn’t come to your party last night, but I wanted to be there, I was caught up with work and couldn’t leave. I’m deeply sorry for not attending your party. I had your gift wrapped properly in my house, as soon as I get back, I will get it across to you. I hope you had fun!
I can meet you this Saturday. I want to go to a nearby lake for fishing or swimming.

3. You are going to walking with your English
You probably have a favorite place to go walking… so do I! I take a short walk a few days a week around my neighborhood, but I love traveling to a more picturesque small-scale “Tu-do” neighborhood located a mere 5-minute drive away! We can look at newly planted flowers, blossoming trees, sometimes stopping for a quick fresh-brewed Capuchino at the cozy family-owned coffee shop. I think I’m going to wear jeans and a shirt. You should bring your camera to take some photos. See you next Friday!
Your friends,
4.Your new penfriend
Hello! My new penfriend, Alex! I have received your letter already. I love your country, but I have never been to your country before. I hope someday you can take me to your country and try the food or live in your home. I’m 21 years old. I have a big, lovely, and happy family because I have one younger sister and two younger brothers. I am the eldest in this home sweet home. Also, I live with my parents, grandma. I have many hobbies such as reading books and playing computer games.
Your penfriend,
5.You have just watched a sport competition
Well, soccer is the only sport that I usually watch with my daddy. I like the competition because it leads to mental development. We all know that a healthy mind resides in a healthy body. Sports also teach me many virtues of life. I learn competition, cooperation, and sportsmanship, which means winning with modesty and losing with grace.
Your friend.
6.You went shopping for clother yesterday
I went shopping for clothes yesterday. I bought a couple of long-sleeved t-shirts and a pair of pants. I paid $99 for them. I also bought three pairs of jeans to replace ones that were about ten years old and quite threadbare. I think my last purchase was a shirt and a sweater last Christmas. All the clothes that I own now have been bought within the last twelve months, even my shoes. I bought my new stuff at the thrift store, mostly.
Your friend,
7.So you finally bougth a mobile phone
Hi Mike. How are you? I bought a cell phone. I can search for information on the internet, I can pay bills and do banking, I can shop and buy things online, and obviously, I can email, text, and call people you know. It also allows me to listen to music, watch videos, navigate and use other apps depending on what I am interested in. I paid $777 for this cell phone. It is white. What do you think?
Write soon.

8.You’ve just had a birthday
Hi there my friend,
I hope this message finds you well. I wanted to share with you the best birthday present I received recently. My mother gifted me a fascinating book that I have been enjoying immensely. Not only has it expanded my knowledge, but it has also been a delightful read. I feel grateful to have such a thoughtful and supportive mother who always manages to surprise me with such amazing gifts.
Take care and talk soon!

9. Sorry I could’t come to birhday party

Looking forward to a fun game of tennis with you!
Best regards, Tom


1. Advantage and disadvantage shopping online.
Online shopping is an increasingly popular trend in modern society. However, like any other shopping method, online shopping also has its own advantages and disadvantages.
One of the biggest advantages of online shopping is saving time and money. You do not need to travel to different stores to find the product you want, and online prices are usually cheaper than traditional stores. Additionally, online shopping can be done 24/7, so you can shop at any time of the day.
However, online shopping also has its limitations. One of these is that you cannot physically inspect the product before purchasing it. This can lead to mistakes in color, material, or size. Furthermore, online shopping can also lead to fraud or violations of your personal information security.
Therefore, online shopping has its own advantages and limitations. If you decide to shop online, make sure you are buying from reputable sellers and always read the terms and conditions carefully before making a transaction.




2.  Advantages and disadvantages of living in a city
Living in a city has both advantages and disadvantages. One of the main advantages is the availability of job opportunities. Cities tend to have a more diverse and expansive job market, providing residents with a greater range of employment options and opportunities for career advancement.
Cities also tend to offer a wide variety of cultural and entertainment options. Museums, theaters, restaurants, and other venues are often concentrated in urban areas, giving residents access to a range of cultural experiences that may not be available in rural areas.
However, living in a city can also have disadvantages. The cost of living is often higher in cities, with housing, food, and transportation costs typically more expensive than in less populated areas. Cities can also be more crowded and stressful, with noise pollution and traffic congestion contributing to a less enjoyable living environment.
In conclusion, living in a city has both advantages and disadvantages. It is important to carefully weigh these factors when considering whether to live in an urban area.
3. Advantages and disadvantages of studying online 
Studying online has become increasingly popular in recent years, especially due to the COVID-19 pandemic. This mode of learning comes with both advantages and disadvantages.
One of the main advantages of studying online is flexibility. Students can learn at their own pace and choose their own study schedule. They can also access course materials and lectures from anywhere with an internet connection, which means they can balance their studies with other commitments such as work or family.
Another advantage is cost-effectiveness. Online courses are often less expensive than traditional in-person courses, which can save students money on tuition fees and other expenses such as transportation and accommodation.
However, studying online also has its disadvantages. One of the biggest challenges is the lack of face-to-face interaction with professors and classmates. This can make it difficult to get feedback on assignments and to build relationships with peers, which can be important for networking and future career opportunities.
In conclusion, studying online offers flexibility and cost-effectiveness, but also has its challenges such as lack of face-to-face interaction and potential distractions. Ultimately, it is up to each individual student to weigh the advantages and disadvantages and decide if online learning is the right choice for them.

4. Advantages and disadvantages of watching TV
Watching television is a popular pastime around the world, but it also has its advantages and disadvantages.
One of the main advantages of watching TV is that it provides entertainment and relaxation. Television programs can be a great source of enjoyment, and they can help people unwind after a long day. TV shows, movies, and documentaries can also be educational, informative, and inspiring.
Another advantage is that TV can bring people together. Watching a popular show or sporting event can create a sense of community and shared experience among viewers. Television can also be a great way to stay up to date with news and current events.
However, watching TV also has its disadvantages. One of the biggest concerns is the potential for excessive screen time. Spending too much time watching TV can lead to a sedentary lifestyle, which can negatively impact physical health and well-being.
Another disadvantage is the potential for exposure to inappropriate content. Some TV programs may contain violence, explicit language, or other mature themes that may not be suitable for all viewers. This can be particularly concerning for children, who may not be able to understand or process such content appropriately.
In conclusion, watching TV can provide entertainment, education, and social connection, but it also has potential drawbacks such as excessive screen time and exposure to inappropriate content. It is important for individuals to be mindful of their TV viewing habits and to choose programs that are appropriate and enjoyable for them.
5. It is said that “Health is gold”. Do you agree?
I mostly agree. Firstly, high health is a precious resource. Secondly, people who have high physical, mental, and emotional health also tend to have more focus, energy, stamina, and flexibility, plus the ability to resist illness. They’re more likely to have growth mindsets, balanced emotions, and clarity about life's purpose. Their creativity flows. Furthermore, health does not depend on physical exercise, but on the cultivation of body and nature. Thirdly, the human body is quite complex. A person can cleanse his heart by valuing De and harboring less desire. In modern society, the increasing popularization of sporting events, the decrease in the human constitution, the prosperity of the pharmaceutical industry, as well as the emergence of strange and serious illnesses are social phenomena that go hand in hand. The intrinsic reason is the degeneration of morality, which stands silently behind these phenomena, a fact that has yet to be recognized by people. This is the foundation of a powerful life. On the other hand, gold can’t replace health.
6. Many people say that eating home-cooked meals for individuals and the family is better than eating out. Do you agree or disagree?
A section of the population believes that preparing a meal and consuming it at home is preferred over overeating at food joints outside. I advocate this notion, as I believe that a home-cooked meal eaten at home brings more health benefits to an individual rather than a restaurant or canteens. I these modern times, cooking at home a meal for oneself has numerous long-term health benefits. In addition, one can prepare healthy food with less fat and sugar to measure a balanced intake of calories. Therefore, the carefully prepared home-cooked meal can increase body metabolism and promote a healthy immune system for a lifetime. Not only this, eating and making food at home can prove to be very economical in terms of expenses. In this context, one can spend more family time while enjoying home-cooked food. Moreover, eating healthy food at home has its benefits considering that one can enjoy eating food at the comfort of a house and spend time together as a family after a busy hectic day. To exemplify, some families strictly have a rule that they should be eating at least one meal of the day together so each member can spend time together. Moreover, families who help each other out in preparation of the family meal, learn to support each other and stay connected. In conclusion, I agree with the belief that home-cooked food is far better and beneficial to the individual as it promotes health as well as economical lifestyle, meanwhile eating at home helps to spend a quality family time.
7. Many people say that learning foreign languages is important in today’s world. Do you agree?
I agree. Firstly, one of the benefits of learning a foreign language is that being bilingual will open up a new world of travel opportunities. For example, speaking French will allow you to travel comfortably around France, Belgium, Luxembourg, Canada, and several African countries while speaking Spanish will enable you to explore Spain and South America. Secondly, speaking a second language will give you the upper hand over other monolingual candidates in the job market, where bilingual candidates are considered to have increased cultural sensitivity, leading to better employee relationships. Thirdly, speaking a foreign language will not only develop your self-confidence but will enable you to become part of two diverse communities – making you smarter, more creative and giving you more opportunities for friendships and love.

8. Air pollution is one of the largest problems the world is facing today. What are some causes of air pollution in your community and what measures can be proposed to solve this problem?
In modern society, air pollution is worldwide becoming a grave concern. While there are several causes for this environmental issue, some effective solutions can be offered to reduce the amount of exhaust fume in the air. There are two major reasons why the atmosphere is seriously polluted. Firstly, means of transport is one of the largest exhaust producers. Recently, because people have generated their income, the number of personal cars and motorbikes has increased significantly. As a result, they released to the air a large amount of carbon dioxide – which causes air pollution. In addition, rubbish burning has happened frequently in urban areas. Therefore, the surrounding areas are contaminated by smoke and burning odor. This environmental issue is difficult to solve, yet there are some possible solutions to minimize it. First of all, to reduce the amount of smoke extricated to the atmosphere, people should be encouraged to use public transport instead of private vehicles. In this way, governments should increase the taxation on cars and motorbikes as well as lower the ticket price of public transport. Moreover, they can also impose laws to control the burning garbage activities by factories and individuals, and fine them if they continue to burn illegally. 
9. Traffic congestion is a serious problem faced by almost every large city. 
What are the causes of traffic congestion? What solutions can you suggest?
Traffic congestion is a serious problem that most large cities face today. There are several causes of traffic congestion, including inadequate road infrastructure, a high number of vehicles on the road, and inefficient traffic management systems. Firstly, the lack of sufficient road infrastructure, such as narrow roads, insufficient number of lanes, and poorly designed intersections, can contribute significantly to traffic congestion. Secondly, the high number of vehicles on the road, such as private cars, buses, and trucks, can also cause traffic jams, especially during peak hours. Lastly, ineffective traffic management systems, including poor traffic signals, inadequate parking facilities, and limited public transportation options, can further exacerbate the problem.

To address this issue, there are several potential solutions. Firstly, developing better road infrastructure, such as widening roads, building more lanes, and improving intersections, can help ease traffic congestion. Secondly, encouraging people to use public transportation, including buses, trains, and subways, can reduce the number of private vehicles on the road. Lastly, implementing smart traffic management systems, including intelligent traffic signals, real-time traffic monitoring, and better parking management, can help reduce traffic congestion in cities.

In conclusion, traffic congestion is a significant problem that requires effective solutions. Improving road infrastructure, promoting public transportation, and implementing smart traffic management systems are just a few potential solutions that can help alleviate traffic congestion in large cities.
